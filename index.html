  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m a college student studying Information Science with a focus on web development. I've always loved to build things with my hands and through coding. I love building clean and functional websites and I’m excited to keep learning and growing as a developer. Currently I'm finishing up my bachelors degree and am beginning my job search. As I continue my journey I plan on getting more certifications and exploring other types of coding so I can be well versed in multiple areas. Outside of work and school I love to polay basketball, go bowling, and spend quality time with my family.</p>
