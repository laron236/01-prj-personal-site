    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As I approach graduation with a Bachelor of Science in Information Science (BSIS) in May 2026, I am focused on transitioning from college into a professional career in software engineering and web-focused technology roles. My education and applied experience have shaped me into what I consider a dual threat professional. I understand how information is created, structured, evaluated, and used, and I apply that understanding directly when designing and building digital systems. With a concentration in web development, I have learned to connect information science principles with hands-on technical implementation, allowing me to create technology that is both functional and user centered. This extended bio highlights the experiences, skills, and goals that define my professional path as I prepare to enter the field.</p>
    <p>Throughout the BSIS program, I developed a strong foundation in information science and user-centered thinking. My coursework emphasized how people seek, interpret, and interact with information across different environments, as well as how data evolves into meaningful knowledge. Through research-driven assignments and analytical projects, I strengthened my ability to evaluate sources, synthesize complex information, and apply theoretical frameworks to real-world problems. This perspective has deeply influenced how I approach technological development, encouraging me to design systems that are intuitive, accessible, and aligned with user needs.</p>
    <p>In parallel, my studies provided extensive exposure to the technical systems that support modern digital environments. I gained an end-to-end understanding of how networks operate, how data is transmitted and stored, and how reliability, performance, and security factors into system design. I also developed a solid foundation in database concepts, including relational modeling, structured query language, and effective data organization. These experiences strengthened my understanding of the back-end systems that power applications and reinforced the importance of building software on well-designed technical foundations.</p>
    <p>My concentration in web development allowed me to bring these information and systems concepts together in practical ways. I developed front-end and full-stack skills through hands-on projects that required designing, structuring, and building complete websites from the ground up. This included creating responsive layouts, validating user input, integrating databases, and developing server-side functionality. Through iterative projects and real-world style workflows, I gained a full understanding of how modern websites are planned, built, and maintained, from interface design to persistent data storage.</p>
    <p>Alongside development, I cultivated a strong interest in user experience and interaction design. I explored how cognitive, social, and emotional factors influence the way people interact with technology, and how thoughtful interface design can improve usability and engagement. By applying design thinking principles and usability evaluation methods, I learned to analyze existing interfaces and design more effective, user-focused solutions. These skills are especially relevant to my interest in web development, automotive UX/UI design, and infotainment systems, where usability and system performance must work seamlessly together.</p>
    <p>One of the most impactful components of my academic journey was my participation in a Career Accelerator Program, which significantly strengthened my practical web development skills and professional readiness. Through this program, I completed all of the major projects showcased on my personal website, gaining hands-on, real-world experience beyond traditional coursework. I worked in both team-based and individual environments, collaborating with peers from diverse backgrounds and across different countries. This experience helped me develop stronger communication, collaboration, and project management skills while adapting to real deadlines and expectations. I also earned multiple certifications through the program, reinforcing my technical skills and commitment to continuous learning.</p>
    <p>Across my academic and applied experiences, I have built a growing technical skill set that includes front-end and full-stack web development, information architecture, database fundamentals, and system analysis. I am comfortable working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, Java, and common development tools, and I continue to strengthen these skills through ongoing coursework and independent learning. I am particularly drawn to front-end development and UX/UI design, but I also recognize the importance of back-end systems, data handling, and performance. As part of my continued growth, I plan to expand my skill set by learning Python and C++, which are widely used in software engineering, data processing, and automotive or embedded systems.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, my career goals include working in software engineering, web development, automotive UX/UI design, or infotainment software engineering roles, where technology directly shapes user experiences. I am especially interested in positions that allow me to combine interface design with underlying system logic, leveraging both my information science background and technical development skills. As I gain professional experience and financial stability, I plan to pursue a master’s degree within the next two to five years to further specialize and advance my career. While I am realistic about beginning in an entry-level role, I have strong long-term ambitions for continuous learning, professional growth, and contributing to innovative, user-centered software solutions.</p>
